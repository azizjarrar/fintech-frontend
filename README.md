# Frontend - React App

This is the frontend application built with **React** and styled using **TailwindCSS**.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- React
- React Router DOM (for routing)
- TailwindCSS (for styling)
- Axios (for API calls, if needed)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azizjarrar/fintech-frontend
   cd fintech-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   or if using default React setup:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open in browser:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## 🌐 Routes

- `/` → Dashboard page
- `/signin` → Sign In page
- `/dashboard/*` → Dashboard sub-routes

(React Router is used to manage navigation between these pages.)

## 🎨 Styling

All the UI is styled with **TailwindCSS**, providing a mobile-first and responsive design approach.



## 📄 Notes

- Make sure the backend server is running and CORS is configured correctly.
- TailwindCSS is already integrated and configured.
